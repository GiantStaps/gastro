# Microsimulation: ESD vs. Surgery Procedure and Recovery

This project uses **R version 4.4.2** and is based on the microsimulation methods from [DARTH-git's Microsimulation Tutorial](https://github.com/DARTH-git/Microsimulation-tutorial).

## Objective

The simulation models and compares patient experiences undergoing Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) versus traditional surgical procedures, focusing on procedural outcomes and recovery trajectories.

## Features

- Simulates individual patient pathways
- Compares health outcomes cost-effectiveness of ESD and surgery

## Dependencies

- R 4.4.2

## Reference

- [Microsimulation Tutorial by DARTH-git](https://github.com/DARTH-git/Microsimulation-tutorial)
